<h2 id="deckhead">Top tennis stars prepare to make a racket in Rio!</h2>

<p>Game, set, match. Itâ€™s time for tennis! The sportâ€™s top superstars are heading to the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. But before the Games get going, take a peek at whoâ€™s good enough for gold!</p>

<p>ðŸŽ¾<big><b>Womenâ€™s Tennis</big></b>ðŸŽ¾</p>

<p>Serena Williams won the singles and doubles titles at the 2012 Olympics. Since then, the American has continued to win. She earned her 22nd major singles title last month at Wimbledon. Thatâ€™s the most ever! Williams will try to add to her legend with another gold medal. </p>

<p>But watch out for Madison Keys! The 21-year-old American (on the cover) hopes to be a hit in her first Games. Angelique Kerber, the worldâ€™s #2-ranked woman (behind Williams), will aim for gold for Germany. And donâ€™t forget Canadaâ€™s Eugenie Bouchard! </p>

<p>ðŸŽ¾<big><b>Menâ€™s Tennis</big></b>ðŸŽ¾</p>

<p>Great Britain waited for years for a champion. It got one in 2012 when Andy Murray won the Olympics â€” and then Wimbledon in 2013. Coming off another Wimbledon win, Murray is a favorite for Rio. But heâ€™ll have to go up against Novak Djokovic! The star from Serbia is the worldâ€™s #1 player! </p>

<p>Sadly, the sport will be without one of its greats. Switzerlandâ€™s Roger Federer is hurt and canâ€™t play. And Rafael Nadal from Spain is not sure if he will be able to play either. He won the gold medal in 2008.</p>

<p>The first matches begin on Saturday, August 6. The champions will get their medals the next weekend!</p>
