<h2 id="deckhead">Top tennis stars prepare to make a racket in Rio!</h2>

<p>Game, set, match. Itâ€™s time for tennis! The sportâ€™s top superstars are heading to the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. But before the Games get going, take a peek at whoâ€™s good enough for gold!</p>

<p>ðŸŽ¾<big><b>Womenâ€™s Tennis</big></b>ðŸŽ¾</p>

<p>Serena Williams won the singles and doubles titles at the 2012 Olympics. Since then, the American has continued to win, win, win. She earned her 22nd major singles title last month at Wimbledon. Thatâ€™s the most in history! Williams, age 34, will try to add to her legend with another gold medal. </p>

<p>But watch out for Madison Keys! The 21-year-old American (on the cover) hopes to make a hit in her first Olympic Games. Angelique Kerber, the worldâ€™s #2-ranked woman (behind Williams), will aim to take down the Americans for Germany. And donâ€™t forget about Canadaâ€™s Eugenie Bouchard! </p>

<p>ðŸŽ¾<big><b>Menâ€™s Tennis</big></b>ðŸŽ¾</p>

<p>Great Britain waited for years for a champion. It got one in 2012 when Andy Murray won the Olympics â€” and then Wimbledon in 2013. Coming off another Wimbledon win this summer, Murray will be a favorite in Rio. But heâ€™ll have to go up against #1-ranked Novak Djokovic from Serbia. </p>

<p>Sadly, the sport will be without one of its greatest players. Switzerlandâ€™s Roger Federer has a knee injury and canâ€™t play for the rest of the year. And Spainâ€™s 2008 gold medalist, Rafael Nadal, is still not sure if he will be able to play. </p>

<p>The first matches begin on Saturday, August 6. Then the champions will get their medals the next weekend!</p>
