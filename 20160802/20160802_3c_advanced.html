<h1 id="mainhead">Harry Potter is Back!</h1>

<h2 id="deckhead">The new book is flying off the shelves!</h2>

<p>The Muggle world is magical again! A new story set in the world of Harry Potter hit bookstores on July 31. This time, readers follow Harry Potter’s son Albus as he starts his own adventure at Hogwarts.</p>

<p>The new tale is called <i>Harry Potter and the Cursed Child</i>, and it’s not like the past seven Harry Potter books — it’s a play! The play premiered at the Palace Theatre in London, England. The new book is actually the play’s script! </p>

<p>The famous author of the books, J.K. Rowling, has said that this will be the end of the Harry Potter series. Since this is such a special story, fans young and old are rushing to bookstores to grab a copy. Books are flying off shelves faster than a Nimbus 2000!</p>

<p>Even some <i>News-O-Matic</i> readers are catching up with the Potters. Austin, age 7, said, “The new Harry Potter book was AWESOME!” Léa, age 12, is especially excited. “I had my own Hogwarts robes, my own broomstick, my own wand, and I’d memorized all the spells,” she wrote in the News Room.</p>

<p>Although this might be the last story about “the boy who lived,” it isn’t the last you’ll see of the world of Harry Potter. In November, a new movie called <i>Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them</i> will premiere. The film is set in the same wizarding world, but this time, it takes place in the United States!</p>
