<h1 id="mainhead">Meet Tokyo’s New Leader!</h1>

<h2 id="deckhead">Japan’s capital city elects its first female governor.</h2>

<p>It’s been a big year for women. Rome got its first female mayor, Virginia Raggi. And Theresa May became the second woman to lead Britain. On Sunday, another woman got a win. Tokyo elected its first female governor!</p>

<p>Yuriko Koike is the new leader. Koike studied in Egypt. She speaks Arabic! She worked as a translator and a TV news anchor. Then she went into politics. In 1992, she started working in the government.</p>

<p>Koike was Japan’s environment minister. She started a program called “cool biz.” It lets workers wear cooler clothing. That means no ties or jackets! That way, businesses use less energy on air conditioning.</p>

<p>Hiroya Masuda and Shuntaro Torigoe also ran for governor. (See Slide Show.) But Koike won by more than a million votes! Tokyo’s former governor was Yoichi Masuzoe. He stepped down in June. He was part of a money scandal. Masuzoe used government money to buy vacations.</p>

<p>Koike has a big job to do. Tokyo has more than 13 million people! And the city has a huge event to get ready for — the 2020 Olympics! Koike says she will get the city ready to host the Games. </p>
