<h1 id="mainhead">“A Big, Stinky Flower!”</h1>

<h2 id="deckhead">New Yorkers line up for a whiff of a corpse flower bloom!</h2>

<p>“It smells like really bad garbage,” said Natalia, age 11. </p>

<p>“It’s like a rotten egg,” said 9-year-old Kofi.</p>

<p>Luis, age 10, also described the corpse flower. “It’s like a skunk and trash,” he told <i>News-O-Matic</i>. “Mixed together.” </p>

<p>These kids lined up to see — and <i>smell</i> — the famous corpse flower. The huge flower blooms about every 10 years. When it does, the bloom only lasts for 24–36 hours. That makes it a very rare event! </p>

<p>On Thursday, a corpse flower bloomed at the New York Botanical Garden (NYBG). Thousands of people waited for a whiff. And, <i>boy</i>, did it stink! </p>

<p>The flower is named for a dead body — because that’s what it smells like! It’s like a rotting animal on a hot day. <i>Ew!</i> The awful smell attracts bugs for pollination. </p>

<p>Then there’s its size. The flower can grow to 10 feet (3 m). That’s taller than any person! Between its stinky smell and huge height, the corpse flower was quite a show. That was great news for NYBG director Marc Hachadourian. </p>

<p>“This is nine years of hard work,” said Hachadourian. The flower comes from the rainforest of Sumatra. But he helped cultivate it in the Bronx, New York. “It’s a real thrill.” He looked at the huge crowd. “It’s a big, stinky flower,” he said. “They all want to smell it!” </p>

<p>But why would anyone want to smell <i>this</i> flower? It smells “like the back of a restaurant,” according to 10-year-old Joanna. Just ask her 12-year-old brother, Erik. (They’re on the front page.) </p>

<p>“This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity,” said Erik. “It doesn’t happen every day.” </p>

<p>Maybe you will be lucky — <i>or unlucky</i> — enough to smell one someday.</p>
