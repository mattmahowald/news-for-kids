<h1 id="mainhead">Meet Tokyo’s New Leader!</h1>

<h2 id="deckhead">Japan’s capital city elects its first female governor.</h2>

<p>It’s been a big year for women in politics. Over the summer, Rome elected its first female mayor, Virginia Raggi. And Theresa May became the second woman ever to lead Britain. On Sunday, another woman got a win. Tokyo elected its first female governor!</p>

<p>Yuriko Koike is the capital city’s new leader. Koike studied in Egypt and speaks fluent Arabic and English. She worked as a translator and a TV news anchor before going into politics. In 1992, she used her popularity from TV to get a job in the government.</p>

<p>Koike was Japan’s environment minister from 2003 to 2006. In that position, she started a countrywide program called “cool biz.” The program allows employees to wear cooler clothing to work in the hot summer months. That means no ties or suit jackets! That way, businesses can turn up the thermostat and use less energy on air conditioning.</p>

<p>Hiroya Masuda and journalist Shuntaro Torigoe also ran for governor. (See Slide Show.) But Koike won the election by more than a million votes! In June, Tokyo’s former governor, Yoichi Masuzoe, stepped down because of a money scandal. Masuzoe admitted to using government money to buy family vacations, spa packages, and works of art.</p>

<p>Koike has a big job to do as governor. Tokyo has more than 13 million people to take care of! And the city has an important international event to get ready for — the 2020 Olympics! Koike says she will work to make Tokyo better for women and get the city ready to host the Games. </p>
