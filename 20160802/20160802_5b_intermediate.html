<h1 id="mainhead">Jupiter’s Red Spot Mystery</h1>

<h2 id="deckhead">Scientists find clues explaining why Jupiter is so hot!</h2>

<p>Jupiter is much farther away from the Sun than Earth is. So it <i>should</i> be much colder. Yet the planet’s atmosphere is burning hot! Temperatures in Jupiter’s sky can reach 2420°F (1330°C). That’s hotter than lava!</p>

<p>For years, no one could explain the mystery of Jupiter’s heat. Now scientists have a clue. They say the planet’s Great Red Spot is causing all the hot air! </p>

<p>Scientist Luke Moore helped make the discovery. “The Great Red Spot is the biggest and most <i>awesomest</i> hurricane in the solar system,” he told <i>News-O-Matic</i>. “It could swallow three Earths,” he said. The strong storm has been raging for hundreds of years.</p>

<p>The Great Red Spot is <i>so</i> powerful that it pushes air out of its way. This creates a lot of noise! “The sounds are like giant ocean waves smashing into rocks,” Moore said. Those crashes actually <i>heat up</i> Jupiter’s sky!</p>

<p>Moore and other scientists used a huge telescope in Mauna Kea, Hawaii, to study Jupiter. He said he was “unbelievably excited” about what he saw. Moore will keep using the telescope to learn about the planet. And a NASA spacecraft named Juno will also tell other secrets of the gas giant. </p>

<p>“We can’t wait to learn more,” said Moore.</p>
