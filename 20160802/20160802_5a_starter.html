<h1 id="mainhead">Jupiter’s Red Spot Mystery</h1>

<h2 id="deckhead">Scientists find clues explaining why Jupiter is so hot!</h2>

<p>Jupiter is very far away from the Sun. So it <i>should</i> be very cold. Yet the planet’s atmosphere is hot! Temperatures in Jupiter’s sky reach 2420°F (1330°C). That’s hotter than lava!</p>

<p>For years, no one understood the mystery of Jupiter’s heat. Now scientists have a clue. They say the planet’s Great Red Spot is causing the hot air! </p>

<p>Scientist Luke Moore helped make the discovery. “The Great Red Spot is the biggest hurricane in the solar system,” he told <i>News-O-Matic</i>. “It could swallow three Earths,” he said. The storm has been raging for hundreds of years.</p>

<p>The Great Red Spot pushes air out of its way. This creates a lot of noise! “The sounds are like giant ocean waves smashing into rocks,” Moore said. Those crashes <i>heat up</i> Jupiter’s sky!</p>

<p>Moore used a huge telescope in Mauna Kea, Hawaii, to study Jupiter. He said he was “excited” about what he saw. Moore will keep trying to learn about the planet. A NASA spacecraft will also tell us about the gas giant. </p>

<p>“We can’t wait to learn more,” Moore said.</p>
