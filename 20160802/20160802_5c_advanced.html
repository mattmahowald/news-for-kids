<h1 id="mainhead">Jupiter’s Red Spot Mystery</h1>

<h2 id="deckhead">Scientists find clues explaining why Jupiter is so hot!</h2>

<p>Jupiter is five times farther away from the Sun than Earth is. So it makes sense then that the giant planet <i>should</i> be much colder. Yet Jupiter’s sky is burning hot! Temperatures in Jupiter’s upper atmosphere can reach 2420°F (1330°C). That’s hotter than lava!</p>

<p>For years, no one could explain the mystery of Jupiter’s heat. Now scientists have a clue for its cause. They say the planet’s Great Red Spot is behind all the hot air! </p>

<p>Scientist Luke Moore from Boston University helped make the discovery. “The Great Red Spot is the biggest and most <i>awesomest</i> hurricane in the solar system,” he told <i>News-O-Matic</i>. “It could swallow three Earths,” he said. The strong storm has been raging for hundreds of years — and possibly a lot longer than that! Its winds reach 400 miles per hour (640 kph), which is stronger than even the wildest tornadoes here on our blue planet! </p>

<p>The Great Red Spot is <i>so</i> powerful that it pushes air out of its way. As it whips around the lower atmosphere, the storm creates a lot of noise! “The sounds are like giant ocean waves smashing into rocks,” Moore said. Those crashes actually <i>heat up</i> Jupiter’s sky, shooting heat hundreds of miles up into the air!</p>

<p>Moore and other scientists used a huge telescope in Mauna Kea, Hawaii, to study Jupiter’s Great Red Spot. He said he was “unbelievably excited” about what he saw. Moore will keep using the telescope to learn about the planet. And a NASA spacecraft named Juno, which arrived in orbit on July 4, may also someday reveal other secrets of the gas giant. </p>

<p>“We can’t wait to learn more,” said Moore.</p>
