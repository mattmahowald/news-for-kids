<h2 id="deckhead">New Yorkers line up for a whiff of a corpse flower bloom!</h2>

<p>“It smells like really, really bad garbage,” said Natalia, age 11. </p>

<p>“It’s like a rotting apple or a rotten egg,” added 9-year-old Kofi.</p>

<p>Luis, age 10, had another way to describe the giant corpse flower. “It’s like a skunk and trash,” he told <i>News-O-Matic</i>. “All mixed together.” </p>

<p>These kids all lined up to see — and <i>smell</i> — the world-famous corpse flower. The huge flower only blooms once every 10 years or so. And when it does, the bloom only lasts for 24–36 hours before the flower collapses. That makes it a very rare event! </p>

<p>On Thursday afternoon, a corpse flower bloomed at the New York Botanical Garden (NYBG) in the Bronx — for the first time since 1939. Thousands of people waited for more than an hour to get a whiff of the plant’s aroma, including <i>News-O-Matic</i>’s editor Russ. And, <i>boy</i>, did it stink! </p>

<p>The <i>corpse</i> flower is named for a dead body — because that’s what it smells like! If you have ever smelled a rotting animal on a hot day, you know how bad that is! The plant uses its awful smell to attract beetles and flies for pollination. </p>

<p>Then there’s the size of it. The freaky flower can grow to 10 feet (3 m), taller than any person who has ever lived! Between its stinky smell and huge height, the corpse flower made for quite a show. That was great news for NYBG director Marc Hachadourian. </p>

<p>“This is nine years of hard work,” Hachadourian said proudly. He helped cultivate a flower that only grows naturally in the rainforest of Sumatra, an island in Southeast Asia in the country of Indonesia. “It’s a real thrill.” The horticulturalist looked around at the crowds of people trying to get the best view. “It’s a big, stinky flower,” he said. “They all want to smell it!” </p>

<p>But <i>why</i> in the world would anyone want to stop and smell a flower that’s “like the back of a restaurant, by the dumpster,” according to 10-year-old Joanna? Just ask her 12-year-old brother, Erik. (That’s them holding their noses on the front page.) </p>

<p>“This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity,” said Erik. “It doesn’t happen every day.” </p>

<p>Maybe you will be lucky — <i>or unlucky</i> — enough to smell one someday.</p>
