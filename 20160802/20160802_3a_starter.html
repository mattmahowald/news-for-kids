<h1 id="mainhead">Harry Potter is Back!</h1>

<h2 id="deckhead">The new book is flying off the shelves!</h2>

<p>The Muggle world is magical again! A new Harry Potter story came out on July 31. It follows Harry Potter’s son Albus. He starts his own adventure at Hogwarts!</p>

<p>The new tale is called <i>Harry Potter and the Cursed Child</i>. But it’s not like the past Harry Potter books — it’s a play! The play premiered in London, England. The book is the play’s script! </p>

<p>The author of the books is J.K. Rowling. She said this is the end of the Harry Potter series. Fans are rushing to bookstores to grab a copy. Books are flying off shelves faster than a Nimbus 2000!</p>

<p>Even some <i>News-O-Matic</i> readers are catching up. Austin, age 7, said, “The new Harry Potter book was AWESOME!” Léa, age 12, is especially excited. “I had my own Hogwarts robes,” she said. “And I’d memorized all the spells.”</p>

<p>However, this isn’t the end of the Harry Potter world. In November, a movie called <i>Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them</i> will premiere. The film is in the same wizarding world. But this time, it’s in the United States!</p>
