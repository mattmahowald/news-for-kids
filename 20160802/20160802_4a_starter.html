<h2 id="deckhead">Top tennis stars prepare to make a racket in Rio!</h2>

<p>Game, set, match. Itâ€™s time for tennis! The sportâ€™s top stars are heading to the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Before the Games begin, check out whoâ€™s going for gold!</p>

<p>ðŸŽ¾<big><b>Womenâ€™s Tennis</big></b>ðŸŽ¾</p>

<p>Serena Williams won the singles gold medal in 2012. Since then, the American has kept winning. She earned her 22nd major singles title last month. Thatâ€™s the most ever! Williams will try to add another gold medal. </p>

<p>But watch out for Madison Keys! (Sheâ€™s on the cover.) The 21-year-old American is playing in her first Games. Angelique Kerber is the worldâ€™s #2-ranked woman (behind Williams). Sheâ€™ll aim for gold for Germany. And donâ€™t forget Canadaâ€™s Eugenie Bouchard! </p>

<p>ðŸŽ¾<big><b>Menâ€™s Tennis</big></b>ðŸŽ¾</p>

<p>Great Britain waited for years for a champion. It got one in 2012 when Andy Murray won the Olympics. Coming off a Wimbledon win, Murray is a favorite. But heâ€™ll have to beat Novak Djokovic! The star from Serbia is the worldâ€™s #1 player! </p>

<p>Sadly, the sport will be without one of its greats. Switzerlandâ€™s Roger Federer is hurt. He canâ€™t play. Rafael Nadal is not sure if he will be able to play either. He won the gold medal in 2008.</p>

<p>The first matches begin on Saturday, August 6. The champions will get their medals the next weekend!</p>
